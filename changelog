Changes in version 2.0.6 (2011-06-22)
-------------------------------------

General
* Forked original files and docs from [tablesorter.com](http://tablesorter.com) to GitHub.
* Replaced alphabetical sort with an alphanumeric sort
  * This "slower" sort can be disabled by setting the `sortLocaleCompare` option to `true`
  * The `sortLocaleCompare` option's default was changed to `false`.
  * Added a very basic demo.
* Added `tableClass` option
  * The value is "tablesorter" by default and should no longer be required in the default markup.
  * This class is applied to the table in the script and should match the css styling.
* Each header cell now has its content wrapped with a span.
  * This allows applying the direction icon to the span instead of the entire cell.
  * Although, this might just be extra markup with the advent of multiple background images and gradient backgrounds available in CSS3.
* Reformatted the code to make jSLint "happier".


Changes in version 2.0.5b (???)
-------------------------------------

* General
 * Added "cssChildRow" option
 * Added "sortLocaleCompare" to use the native `String.localeCampare` method.
 * Added "onRenderHeader" function that is called when classes are added to the header cells.
 * Added "selectorHeaders" option to target the the header cells.
