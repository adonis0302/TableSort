tablesorter is a jQuery plugin for turning a standard HTML table with THEAD and TBODY tags into a sortable table without page refreshes.

#### Version 2.0.30 (2012-2-20)

* Fixed the total mess I just made with the addWidget init functionality... I need a vacation :P

#### Version 2.0.29 (2012-2-20)

* Fixed a problem with the addWidget init function which apparently was always being called, even if you didn't want it! Fix for [issue #28](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/28). Thanks to thezoggy for helping with troubleshooting!
* Minor cleanup of sorting class names code.

#### Version 2.0.28.1 (2012-2-16)

* Modified the plugin pager to ignore child rows. Fix for [issue #27](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/27).

#### Version 2.0.28 (2012-2-1)

* Added a new function to widgets called "init" which is called upon initialization, before any of the widgets are applied.
  * I added it to allow the "saveSort" widget to get the saved sort data (localStorage or cookie) before the initial sort was applied.
  * The "saveSort" widget is still compatible with the original tablesorter, but the original version will call all of the widgets twice on initialization, if using the "saveSort" widget.
  * New add widget format is as follows:

        ```javascript
        $.tablesorter.addWidget({
          id: 'myWidget',
          init: function(table, allWidgets, thisWidget){
            // widget initialization code - this is only run ONCE
            // but in this example I call the format function because
            // I want to keep it backwards compatible with the original tablesorter
            thisWidget.format(table, true);
          },
          format: function(table, initFlag) {
            // widget code to apply to the table AFTER EACH SORT
            // the initFlag is true when format is called for the first time, but
            // only if it is called from the init function
          }
        });
        ```

#### Version 2.0.27 (2012-1-31)

* Added `sortReset` option
  * Setting this option to `true`, allows you to click on the header a third time to clear the sort
  * Clearing the sort DOES NOT return the table to it's initial unsorted state.
* Added `saveSort` widget
  * This widget will save the last sort to local storage, and will fallback to cookies.
  * The widget does use the `JSON.stringify` function which is [not fully supported](http://caniuse.com/#search=json) (IE7), so if you plan to support it and use this widget, please include this [JSON library](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js).
* Fixed pager page size not sticking. Fix for [issue #24](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/24).
