tablesorter (FORK) is a jQuery plugin for turning a standard HTML table with THEAD and TBODY tags into a sortable table without page refreshes.
tablesorter can successfully parse and sort many types of data including linked data in a cell. This forked version adds lots of new enhancements including: alphanumeric sorting, pager callback functons, multiple widgets providing column styling, ui theme application, sticky headers, column filters and resizer, as well as extended documentation with a lot more demos.

### Notice!

* Because of the change to the internal cache, the tablesorter v2.16+ core, filter widget and pager (both plugin &amp; widget) will only work with the same version or newer files.

#### <a name="v2.23.1">Version 2.23.1</a> (8/19/2015)

* Core
  * Prevent js error when `$.tablesorter.showError` is called without a string. Fixes [issue #997](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/997).
  * Updated `$.tablesorter.showError` function by including a `settings` parameter; a parameter passed by jQuery's `.ajaxError()` method, but was previously omitted.

    ```js
    $.tablesorter.showError( table, xhr, settings, exception );
    ```

    I didn't bump the minor version as this is somewhat on the edge of calling this a breaking change.

* Pager
  * Include `settings` parameter from ajaxError method, between the `xhr` and `exception` parameters to match the order of parameters returned by jQuery [`.ajaxError()` method](http://api.jquery.com/ajaxError/).

    ```js
    ajaxError: function( config, xhr, settings, exception ){ return exception; };
    ```

#### <a name="v2.23.0">Version 2.23.0</a> (8/17/2015)

* Core:
  * Prevent `addRows` error. See [issue #979](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/979).
  * Make all updating methods public
    * Call a function instead of triggering an event on the table. Changes include:
      * `$.tablesorter.addRows` - called by `addRows` method.
      * `$.tablesorter.appendCache` - renamed from `appendToTable`; appends cache
          to DOM, called by `appendCache` method.
      * `$.tablesorter.isEmptyObject` - clone of `$.isEmptyObject` (jQuery v1.4).
      * `$.tablesorter.sortOn` - called by `sortOn` method.
      * `$.tablesorter.sortReset` - called by `sortReset` method.
      * `$.tablesorter.updateAll` - called by `updateAll` method.
      * `$.tablesorter.updateCache` - called by `updateCache` method.
      * `$.tablesorter.updateCell` - called by `updateCell` method.
      * `$.tablesorter.update` - called by `update` and `updateRows` method.
  * `addRows` now accepts a row string *if only one tbody exists* in the table.
    * The one tbody does not include information only tbodies (which have a class name from `cssInfoBlock`).
    * Previously, you had to make a jQuery object, append it to the table, then pass a reference containing the new rows.
    * This method doesn't work if a table has multiple tbodies, because the plugin doesn't know where you want to add the rows.
    * Also, updated the debug message for this method.
  * Use header cells instead of references to prevent IE8 error. Fixes [issue #987](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/987).
  * Fix above header cell targetting causing a javascript error in jQuery v1.2.6. Fixes [issue #995](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/995).
  * Add `updateHeaders` method
    * Triggered event & public api function.
    * `$.tablesorter.updateHeaders` - called by `updateHeaders` method.
    * Fixes [issue #989](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/989).
* Docs:
  * Update jQuery UI theme switcher URLs.
* ColumnSelector:
  * Modify `refreshColumnSelector` method so it also updates the contents of the container in case of changes to the header text, column priorities, etc.
  * See examples of these changes in the column selector [methods section](http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/example-widget-column-selector.html#methods).
  * Fixes [issue #985](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/985).
* Editable:
  * Improve column option parsing. Fixes issues [#982](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/982) & [#979](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/979).
* Filter:
  * Fix js error caused when limiting search columns - external "any" filter targeting specific columns; see [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/q/32052986/145346).
* Pager:
  * Widget only: No more javascript error in widget ajax error message.
  * Addon only: replace use of `$.isEmptyObject` which was not available in jQuery v1.2.6.
  * Change enable, disable & destroy trigger methods.
    * Previously, these methods had to include a `.pager` namespace: `enable.pager`, `disable.pager` & `destroy.pager`.
    * These methods stopped working when unique pager namespaces were added.
    * New trigger methods are named as follows: `enablePager`, `disablePager` & `destroyPager`.
    * Fixes [issue #980](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/980).
  * Unbind pager controls on destroy. Fixes [issue #981](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/981).
  * Add `ajaxError` callback function. Fixes [issue #992](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/992).
* Parsers:
  * parser-input-select: fix javascript error when no rows returned.
* Misc & Testing
  * Miscellaneous cleanup of testing code.
  * Add empty `ignore` entry to bower.json. Fixes [issue #991](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/991).
  * Fix license in package.json to match the new spdx license expression syntax.

#### <a name="v2.22.5">Version 2.22.5</a> (7/28/2015)

* Overall:
 * Set JSHint "undef" & "unused" options. Fixed issues.
 * The math widget was throwing a javascript error after missing a changed variable name & JSHint wasn't catching it, until now.
